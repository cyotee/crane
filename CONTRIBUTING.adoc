=== Real Case scenario
* When you first open VScode, you will see this window
** image:https://i.imgur.com/SbKV4lf.png[VSCode Window]
* Go on github, click on CODE, HTTPS and copy it
** image:https://i.imgur.com/dCvZO3N.png[CODE copy]
* back to Vscode, click on Clone Git repositor, then press CTRL+P (Quick open) and copy the link you copied above
** image:https://i.imgur.com/WUeXfbq.png[VSCODE Clone Repo]
* Select the repository location on your workstation
** image:https://i.imgur.com/zjrwRCh.png[Cloning Repo]
* Well done, you did clone your repo
* now, you can work on your repo, check on the left side, you do have few icons which will be very useful, called Activity Bar
** image:https://i.imgur.com/SwK5JxD.png[Vscode Icon]
. Explorer : The Explorer is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. VS Code is file and folder based - you can get started immediately by opening a file or folder in VS Code.
. Search: Provides global search and replace across your open folder.
. Source Control - VS Code includes Git source control by default.
.. image:https://i.imgur.com/bzL5MY4.png[Source Control]
... you can here push, pull, commit, change, create-delete-modify branch etc..
. Run - VS Code's Run and Debug View displays variables, call stacks, and breakpoints.
. Extensions - Install and manage your extensions within VS Code.
. Custom views - Views contributed by extensions.

* *Never Ever work on the Branch Master , create new branch each time you work on a task, if the task do not exist, create an issue accordingly.*
* then do a pull requests if your issues has been approved. Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

=== Signed Git commits in VSCode
* This only explain how to configure it on VSCode, to know how to create PGP key and set up in Github, click HERE
. you have to tell VS Code to append the -s flag to the git commit command, to use signed committing now. 
. Open the settings, search for “gpg” and check the box “Enables commit signing with GPG”.
. that’s it! Now you can commit your changes in VS Codes Git integration and sign your work.
. Note that you will be prompted for the passphrase of your private key at first.
. your commits are now verified on VSCode.

=== Diagrams in VSCode
* Diagrams are allowed in a few formats (SVG, PlantUML, Graphviz, and DITAA are allowed for now, other might be added) All of them are text based (Mostly for technical diagrams with specific styles that are easier to write in that format)

* The primary one, especially for non-technical stuff is Draw.io. It embeds it's editor data in a standard SVG. SVG is a text based image format that's compatible with git. A lot of other frameworks accept SVG along with other image formats. Meaning SVG is our preferred image format.

==== Draw.io Integration
- *This plugin provides a graphical editor for diagrams in SVG format. We'll be using this for everything. There is a web service for it, but the tool doesn't require it. Eventually we'll make sure an open source version is available.*

=== AsciiDoc
- All our docs will be written in AsciiDoc. We will often render to DocBook format first before rendering to other formats because a lot of tools with with DocBook. So if we can't find a tool that just works with AsciiDoc, we'll likely find one that works with DocBook.
* This plugin makes working with AsciiDoc easier.

=== Radicle
* Radicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols. It enables developers to collaborate on code without relying on trusted intermediaries. Radicle was designed to provide similar functionality to centralized code collaboration platforms — or "forges" — while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
** We will be using it in the future so we are strongly advising you to get familair with it. More notes and comments will be written later on on this topic.
** Read about it : link:https://docs.radicle.xyz/[Radicle Docs]

== Download GPGSuite 
* Use GPG Suite to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify files or messages. Manage your GPG Keychain with a few simple clicks and experience the full power of GPG easier than ever before.

** link:https://gpgtools.org/[GPGSuite for MAC] / Download Gpg4Win link:https://www.gpg4win.org/[GPG4win for Windows]

== Keybase 

link:https://keybase.io/[Keybase.io], register yourself, download-install it. Finally, Validate your email. then import the GPG Key once you've generated as below.

** Command line to import it : keybase pgp import -i your path of GPG.asc
** feel free to prove more of your identity on Keybase.

== GPG-KEY
=== What is Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) ?
* Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. 
* PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications (we will use PGP Key to configure our commits on Windows in this guideline but I'm covering below GPG for your reference as it will be use in <<How to use the PGP Key to sign commits on Github for Windows>>

=== What is GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) ?
* GnuPG is a hybrid-encryption software program because it uses a combination of conventional symmetric-key cryptography for speed, and public-key cryptography for ease of secure key exchange, typically by using the recipient's public key to encrypt a session key which is used only once. 
* This mode of operation is part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version. 
* The GnuPG 1.x series uses an integrated cryptographic library, while the GnuPG 2.x series replaces this with Libgcrypt. GnuPG encrypts messages using asymmetric key pairs individually generated by GnuPG users. The resulting public keys may be exchanged with other users in a variety of ways, such as Internet key servers. 
* They must always be exchanged carefully to prevent identity spoofing by corrupting public key < > "owner" identity correspondences. 
* It is also possible to add a cryptographic digital signature to a message, so the message integrity and sender can be verified, if a particular correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted. GnuPG also supports symmetric encryption algorithms. 
* By default, GnuPG uses the AES symmetrical algorithm since version 2.1,CAST5 was used in earlier versions. 
* GnuPG does not use patented or otherwise restricted software or algorithms. Instead, GnuPG uses a variety of other, non-patented algorithms.

=== Why Sign your Git commits?
* It is important to sign Git commits for your source code to avoid the code being compromised and to confirm to the repository gatekeeper that you are who you say you are. Signing guarantees that my code is my work, it is my copyright and nobody else can fake it. This guide provides the necessary steps to creating private & public keys so you can sign your Git commits.

=== How to Create-Configure PGP Key ?
* Setting up PGP keys with Git on Windows can be more difficult to configure than on Mac OS or Linux. Here’s how to set it up.
. On Windows
.. Download and install link:https://www.gpg4win.org/get-gpg4win.html[PGP4Win], leave everything as default during the installation.
.. Open Kleopatra and click on fiel > create new key pair
.. Choose Create a personal OpenPGP key pair
... image:https://i.imgur.com/XrHzUyj.png[Kleopatra new key pair]
.. Enter Details : Username - Email , tick "Protect the generated key with a passphrase" (save your passphrase!!!)
.. go to advanced, change the RSA to 4096 bits, adjust the validation time if needed.
... image:https://i.imgur.com/48cpwNJ.png[Configuration KEY]
... image:https://i.imgur.com/vzVXiev.png[Passphrase]
.. Great! Now you have configured your PGP key!! Store the keypair on your machine by selecting an option “Make a Backup of your keypair”. This will store two files, one is private key and one is public key.
*Private key must not be shared by anyone else.* Public Key can be shared with anyone so that they can share the secrets in an encrypted form.
... image:https://i.imgur.com/WEdjces.png[KEY created]
. On MAC
.. this link cover from the creation of your key to verified your commits. link:https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/signed-verified-git-commits-keybase-rstudio/[GPG  guideline On MAC]

=== How to use the PGP Key to sign commits on Github for Windows
* Git BASH Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. let's download link:https://gitforwindows.org/[Git For Windows], install it.
. Next, open up a new Powershell window and run where.exe gpg to get the exact location of the GPG program installed withGPG4Win, copy the path.
. launch git bash on windows
. type this command git config --global gpg.program "PATH_HERE" (copy/paste the path got on powershell)
.. this command tells Git what program to use to open it.
. You have two options for signing commits and tags. You can either force signing for all Git projects with the --global flag, or force signing for specific projects with the --local flag. 
Since I have some projects that require code signing, I’m going to use the global option. If you want to use this GPG key ID for all Git repositories use the --global option, otherwise use --local
. First, force Git to sign all commits in this project: git config --global commit.gpgsign true 
.. image:https://i.imgur.com/g3E36gt.png[commit.gpgsign]
. Then, get the ID of your GPG key, back to Kleopatra and see your key under KEY-ID on the main window.
. Add that ID from above to your Git config: git config --global user.signingkey "[GPG_KEY]", (Make sure to replace “GPG_KEY” with the ID from your GPG key in the previous command)
. finally, enable the GPG feature on VSCode or your Editor of your choice.
. Any commits will be verified from now on (will ask your passphrase configured with your key)
