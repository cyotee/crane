     * margin).

     * liquidity pools with high centeredness and small swaps), it may nonetheless be useful for some applications,
     * such as off-chain indicators.
     *
     * The state depends on the current balances and centeredness margin, and it uses the *last* virtual balances in
     * the calculation. This is fine because the real balances can only change during an operation, and the margin can
     * only change through the permissioned setter - both of which update the virtual balances. So it is not possible
     * for the current and last virtual balances to get out-of-sync.
