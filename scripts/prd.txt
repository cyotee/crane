## Concepts

### Diamond Proxy Pattern
The [Diamond Proxy pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) is a design pattern for creating upgradeable smart contracts. It consists of:
- **Diamond Contract**: A proxy contract that routes function calls to appropriate facets.
- **Facets**: Separate contracts containing specific functionalities.
- **Storage Layout**: Uses patterns like Diamond Storage to manage state variables.

### Crane Framework Architecture
The Crane Framework includes:
- **Diamond Contract**: The main contract for routing calls.
- **Facets**: Modular contracts for specific features (e.g., ERC20, ERC721).
- **On-Chain Factory**: A smart contract for deploying new Diamond Proxies.
- **Development Tools**: Scripts for testing, deployment, and package management.

### Compatibility and Interoperability
The Crane Framework is designed to be compatible with existing Ethereum standards and interoperable with other tools and protocols. Key considerations include:
- **ERC Standards**: Ensure facets comply with standards like ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 for token interactions.
- **Proxy Pattern Compatibility**: Support integration with other proxy patterns (e.g., Transparent Proxy, UUPS) where applicable.
- **Tooling**: Compatibility with popular development tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and Foundry for testing and deployment.
- **Cross-Chain Considerations**: Explore potential extensions for cross-chain compatibility using bridges or layer-2 solutions.

## Framework Usage

### Creating a New Project
1. Initialize a new Hardhat project within the Crane repository:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat init
   ```
2. Configure `hardhat.config.js` to include Crane Framework dependencies.

### Writing Facets
Facets are individual contracts containing specific functionalities. Example:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title ExampleFacet
/// @notice A facet for managing a simple counter
contract ExampleFacet {
    /// @notice Increments the counter
    function increment() external {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Defining the Diamond Contract
The Diamond contract routes calls to facets. Example setup:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Diamond.sol";

/// @title CraneDiamond
/// @notice Main Diamond contract for the Crane Framework
contract CraneDiamond is Diamond {
    constructor(address _owner) Diamond(_owner) {}
}
```

### Using the On-Chain Factory
The on-chain factory deploys new Diamond Proxies. Example:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title CraneFactory
/// @notice Factory for deploying Diamond Proxies
contract CraneFactory {
    /// @notice Deploys a new Diamond Proxy
    function deployDiamond(address _owner) external returns (address) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Upgrading Contracts
To upgrade a facet:
1. Deploy a new facet contract.
2. Update the Diamond contract's facet cut using the `diamondCut` function.

### Example Use Cases
To help developers understand practical applications of the Crane Framework, the following use cases provide step-by-step guides for common scenarios:

1. **Creating an ERC20 Token**:
   - Initialize a new project with Crane Framework.
   - Use or create an ERC20 facet with standard functions (e.g., `transfer`, `balanceOf`).
   - Configure the Diamond contract to route calls to the ERC20 facet.
   - Deploy using the on-chain factory.
   - Test token functionality with Hardhat.

2. **Building an NFT Marketplace**:
   - Set up facets for ERC721 (NFTs), marketplace logic, and auction functionality.
   - Define interactions between facets in the Diamond contract.
   - Deploy and test listing, bidding, and transferring NFTs.

3. **Upgradeable DeFi Protocol**:
   - Implement facets for lending, borrowing, and interest calculation.
   - Test initial deployment, then upgrade a facet (e.g., update interest calculation logic).
   - Verify state preservation and new functionality.

These examples will be expanded with detailed code snippets and tutorials in the documentation to assist developers in adapting the framework to their needs.

### Publishing as an npm Package

     ```bash
     npx crane-init my-diamond-project
     cd my-diamond-project
     npm install
     ```

3. **Versioning and Releases**:
   - Follow semantic versioning (e.g., `0.1.0` for initial release, increment for updates).
   - Use Git tags for releases:
     ```bash
     git tag v0.1.0
     git push origin v0.1.0
     ```
   - Document release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` for each version.

4. **Publish to npm**:
   - Log in to npm:
     ```bash
     npm login
     ```
   - Publish the package:
     ```bash
     npm publish --access public
     ```
   - If using a scoped package, ensure it's public or adjust access as needed.

5. **Maintain and Support**:
   - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and publishing on new releases.
   - Monitor issues on GitHub and respond to community feedback.
   - Update documentation and examples as the framework evolves.

By following these steps, the Crane Framework can be shared with the Solidity development community, enabling others to build modular, upgradeable smart contracts with ease.

### Implementing Tests
Before finalizing the documentation, comprehensive testing is crucial to ensure the Crane Framework's reliability and security. Follow these steps to implement tests:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for each facet and the Diamond contract using Hardhat or Foundry.
   - Cover all functions and edge cases, focusing on state management and function routing.
   - **Library Function Tests**: Ensure discrete unit tests are written for all library functions used within the framework, separate from facet or Diamond contract tests. Test each function independently to verify correctness, input validation, and expected outputs.
   - Example test structure for facets:
     ```javascript
     const { expect } = require('chai');
     describe('ExampleFacet', function () {
       it('should increment counter correctly', async function () {
         // Test implementation
       });
     });
     ```
   - Example test structure for library functions:
     ```javascript
     const { expect } = require('chai');
     describe('CraneLibrary', function () {
       it('should handle utility function correctly', async function () {
         // Test implementation for a specific library function
       });
       it('should validate inputs for another library function', async function () {
         // Test implementation for another library function
       });
     });
     ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between the Diamond contract and multiple facets.
   - Verify upgradeability by testing facet replacement and addition.

3. **Security Tests**:
   - Include tests for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy and gas limit issues.
   - Use tools like Slither or Mythril for static analysis alongside manual testing.

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Aim for high test coverage (e.g., 90% or above) to ensure robustness.
   - Use Hardhat's coverage plugin to measure and report coverage:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat coverage
     ```

### Adding Code Comments
Code comments are essential for maintainability and to assist in generating accurate documentation. Add comments to both source and test code as follows:

1. **Source Code Comments**:
   - Use NatSpec comments for all Solidity contracts, functions, and state variables.
   - Follow the [NatSpec Format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) for consistency.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     /// @title ExampleFacet
     /// @notice A facet for managing a simple counter
     contract ExampleFacet {
         /// @notice Increments the counter
         /// @return The new counter value
         function increment() external returns (uint256) {
             // Implementation
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Test Code Comments**:
   - Comment test cases to explain the purpose and expected behavior.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Test that increment function updates counter correctly
     it('should increment counter correctly', async function () {
         // Test implementation
     });
     ```

3. **Review and Update**:
   - After implementing tests and initial comments, review and update comments to reflect any changes or insights gained during testing.
   - Ensure comments are accurate and detailed to support documentation generation.

## Development Tools

### Testing
Use Hardhat to write and run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deployment
Deploy to a local testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Best Practices

### Secure Coding
- Use [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/solidity-contracts) for battle-tested implementations.
- Avoid reentrancy vulnerabilities.

### Gas Optimization
- Minimize storage operations by using efficient data structures (e.g., mappings over arrays where possible).
- Optimize facet design to reduce the number of delegate calls, as each call in the Diamond Proxy pattern incurs additional gas costs.
- Use `immutable` and `constant` keywords for variables that don't change to save gas.
- Batch operations in facets when feasible to reduce transaction overhead.
- Profile gas usage with Hardhat's gas reporter to identify and optimize expensive functions.

### Versioning and Upgradeability
- Maintain versioned facets for compatibility, using semantic versioning (e.g., `FacetNameV1`, `FacetNameV2`).
- Document changes in facet upgrades to track breaking changes or new features.
- **Framework Versioning**: Adopt semantic versioning for the Crane Framework itself (e.g., `1.0.0` for stable release). Update the version in `package.json` and tag releases in Git.
- **Contract Versioning**: Ensure the Diamond contract can handle multiple facet versions and provide a clear upgrade path for users.
- **Release Notes**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes across framework and contract versions.

### Security Considerations
Security is paramount when using the Diamond Proxy pattern due to its dynamic nature. Follow these guidelines to mitigate risks:
- **Storage Management**: Use Diamond Storage or similar patterns to prevent storage collisions between facets. Never directly write to storage slots without proper layout management.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access control in the Diamond contract to restrict who can perform `diamondCut` operations (e.g., use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or role-based access).
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guard against reentrancy attacks in facets, especially those handling funds, by using non-reentrant modifiers (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`).
- **Function Selector Clashes**: Ensure function selectors in different facets do not clash unintentionally, which could lead to incorrect routing. Use tools to audit selectors during development.
- **Audit and Testing**: Conduct thorough security audits and use fuzzing tools to test for vulnerabilities. Engage third-party auditors for critical releases.
- **Emergency Stop**: Include an emergency stop mechanism in the Diamond contract to pause operations if a vulnerability is detected.

### Development Workflow
- **Implementation First**: Complete the core implementation of the Diamond contract, facets, and factory.
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests as outlined in the 'Implementing Tests' section.
- **Commenting**: Add and update NatSpec comments in source code and explanatory comments in test code.
- **Documentation**: Write user documentation only after tests and comments are in place to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **Packaging**: Prepare and publish the framework as an npm package once all components are tested and documented.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Deployment Failure**: Ensure sufficient gas and correct network configuration.
- **Facet Not Found**: Verify facet addresses in the Diamond contract.

### Debugging
- Use Hardhat's console.log for debugging.
- Check transaction logs for errors.
